# tightrope

Tightrope is a simple but speedy text editor written in C++11. Currently only works on Windows as it uses Direct2D and DirectWrite for rendering.

### Building

Clone the repository using `git clone --recurse-submodules` to grab the editor code as well as any submoduled dependencies.
Then build using CMake or open in Visual Studio as a CMake project and build that way.
